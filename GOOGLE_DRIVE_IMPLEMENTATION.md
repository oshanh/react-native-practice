### 2. **Updated Backup System** (`utils/backupV2.ts`)
- Now tries to upload to Google Drive first (if signed in)
- Falls back to configured upload endpoint
- Falls back to share sheet if not signed in
- Shows appropriate success messages

### 3. **New About Screen** (`app/(tabs)/about.tsx`)
- Beautiful UI to sign in/out of Google Drive
- Shows current sign-in status
- Displays signed-in user email
- Simple one-tap sign-in with Google

### 4. **Updated Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- "Backup Now" button uploads directly to Google Drive (if signed in)
- Shows "Backup uploaded to Google Drive successfully! ☁️" message

### 5. **Configuration** (`app.json`)
- Added Google Drive config section
- Added Google Sign-In plugin

## 🚀 Next Steps - IMPORTANT!

Before this will work, you need to set up Google Cloud credentials:

### Quick Setup (15 minutes):

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create a project** (or use existing)
3. **Enable Google Drive API**:
   - APIs & Services > Library > Search "Google Drive API" > Enable
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID
   - Choose "Android"
   - Get SHA-1 fingerprint:
     ```bash
     cd android
     ./gradlew signingReport
     # Copy SHA-1 from 'Variant: debug'
     ```
   - Package name: `com.oshandev.debitm1`
   - Paste your SHA-1
   - Create

5. **Create Web Client ID** (Required!):
   - Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID > Web application
   - Create
   - **Copy the Client ID** - you'll need this!

6. **Update `app.json`**:
   ```json
   "googleDrive": {
     "webClientId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_WEB_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   }
   ```

7. **Rebuild the app**:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   npx expo run:android
   ```

### Detailed Instructions:
See `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md` for complete step-by-step instructions with screenshots!

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Users:
1. Open the app
2. Go to **About** tab
3. Tap **"Sign In with Google"**
4. Choose your Google account
5. Grant Drive access
6. Done! Now every backup automatically goes to Google Drive ☁️

### Automatic Backup Flow:
```
User clicks "Backup Now"
  ↓
Is user signed in to Google Drive?
  ↓ YES → Upload to Google Drive directly ✅
  ↓ NO  → Show share sheet (user can still choose Google Drive manually)
```

### Background Backups:
- Every 6 hours, background task runs
- If signed in to Google Drive: Uploads automatically
- If not signed in: Saves locally

## 📦 New Dependencies Added

```json
"@react-native-google-signin/google-signin": "Latest"
"axios": "Latest"
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ Only requests `drive.file` scope (can only access files it creates)
- ✅ Cannot access your other Google Drive files
- ✅ Backups stored in dedicated folder
- ✅ Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- ✅ User can revoke access anytime from Google Account settings

## 🎨 UI Features

### About Screen:
- Clean, modern design
- Shows sign-in status
- Displays user email when signed in
- One-tap sign in/sign out
- Loading states for better UX

### Home Screen:
- "Backup Now" button
- Smart feedback messages:
  - "Backup uploaded to Google Drive successfully! ☁️" (when signed in)
  - "Backup saved locally" (when not signed in)
